# Lox langauge using Python and C++ (WIP)

This repository contains an implementation of the Lox programming language from Robert Nystrom's book  *Crafting Interpreters* . The project is divided into two parts:

1. **Python Implementation (Part I)** : A tree-walk interpreter for the Lox language, following the first part of the book. This serves as an accessible and concise implementation.
2. **C++ Implementation (Part II)** : A high-performance bytecode interpreter for Lox, built during the second part of the book.

## What is Lox?

**Lox** is a programming language designed by  **Robert Nystrom** , the author of the book  *"Crafting Interpreters"* . It is a simple, dynamically-typed scripting language used primarily for educational purposes. The language is designed to be easy to implement and understand, making it an excellent tool for learning how programming languages and interpreters work.
