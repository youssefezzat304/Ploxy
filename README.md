# Lox langauge using Python and C++ (WIP)

---

This repository contains an implementation of the Lox programming language from Robert Nystrom's book  *Crafting Interpreters* . The project is divided into two parts:

1. **Python Implementation (Part I)** : A tree-walk interpreter for the Lox language, following the first part of the book. This serves as an accessible and concise implementation.
2. **C++ Implementation (Part II)** : A high-performance bytecode interpreter for Lox, built during the second part of the book.
